# Clinica - 2003 to 2014 project from VB6 to VB.NET - Please read this before and consider the whole picture
Main project did in my closed company. Here for educational purpose and to show what I did for those interested.

This project was started using Visual Basic 6 with Access and ended in VB.NET with MSSQL. 

It was initially programmed in French/English, but I finally decided to program only in English so there is still some names in French. Be advised! It has been slowly translated, but not completely.

Also, the OOP paradigm transformation was never ended. So if this project would be start off from the ground, it would be split into more plugins, better layers, multilanguages support, full OOP and more.

It was run on Windows XP for the first time and passed through Windows 7 and Windows 10.

## Important achievements (No particular order)
- POP3 implementation
- Real-time communications
